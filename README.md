Alternative portal to download my open-source Clinical Information System source code. Designed using the C#.NET 3.5 Framework. The data records are managed using the MySQL database server 5.2 version. It is designed to operate within a local networked structure with the database setup on the network server while the application itself installed and operating on each workstation.
